7839,I am suicidal. i want to die and i want to give up. I am desperately clinging on to the last thread. there is still so much i want to experience in life but i do not have enough motivation to go on any longer. i do not want to go before my mother. and i want just one person to listen to my story and tell me I have worked hard. i want to know from a professional stance if I am being too weak or if anyone in my shoes would have done better than i did. would it be safe for me to go to therapy and be honest about my suicidal thoughts without the risk of being sent to a mental hospital against my will? last ditch effort: therapy?,Suicidal
46091,"I have bipolar and will begin a post-doctoral fellowship researching my own disease in may! Hi! This is my first post in this sub. I’m super excited to share that I’m going to start studying the genetics of bipolar disorder in a couple of months for my post doc.  I just graduated with a PhD in biology studying DNA repair.  I’m going to be studying the exact mechanism of how lithium works to make people feel better and also why/whether there is a genetic component to why some people with bipolar attempt suicide and why others don’t.  This is all extremely personal for me since I have had bipolar I for 12 years and my wife also has bipolar disorder. Anyway, I hope some of you find this interesting/uplifting/cool. Cheers!",Bipolar

19004,"I have been working my first 40 hours a week job for a year now and it is ruining my life. Even though I get 7.5-8.5 hours sleep a night, I come home exhausted every day, with no energy to do more than browse the internet or watch tv. When I was a student I would religiously go to gym three times a week. I have tried going three times while working, but some days I am just so tired I cannot make it. I am lucky if I go twice. I am getting fat and gross and I do not like how I look. I have no energy to do chores so my place gets messy all week and I spend a day on the weekend just cleaning and doing errands, and often all my chores still do not get done. I have no energy for socializing during the week, so my last free day is spent with my girlfriend who complains that she never sees me anymore. I do not have time for other friends or family. I miss having time to do art, truly relax, or even just walk around and observe the world. Now I feel like I am constantly rushing around with little energy to devote to life outside work. My diet is getting worse, too. On a good day I manage to make myself a tuna sandwich, but most of the time I am just eating yogurt and crackers for dinner since it basically takes no effort. I am finding I am relying more on fast food.Please do not tell me 40 hours is nothing and I am lucky I am not working 60 hour work week. The fact that I am on the lower end of what some jobs expect causes me an immense amount of dread if my job starts expecting more of me.

15716,"So it appears that it is pretty much over for me. I am a 24 year old male, living with my mother, unemployed, no girlfriend and almost no social life. I am a little chubby (30lbs or so overweight), but other than that I look fine. I have a bachelor's degree in Physics and now I am entering my final year as a master's student in Solid State Physics. It seems that I simply cannot get a job and do something with my life. No one wants to hire me, not even for jobs for which I am overqualified. I feel terribly lonely and nothing seems to work. I feel that my chances of getting out of this situation are getting slimmer every day. I may have to make peace with the idea that I will be unemployed and a loser for the rest of my life. I do not know what to do. People keep telling me that things will get better in time, but so far, it seems that time only made things worse. I am considering a 7 day water and electrolytes fast since I have done it before and I have plenty of body fat to lose and it is rather safe in my case. Maybe the fast will also bring some mental clarity. I do not know if I am actually depressed since I am willing to at least try to change my situation, but it feels like if I do not get my life sorted out soon enough, I may get depressed for real and that kind of scares me because at that point, I will have no motivation left to actually do anything.

15666,"Hi! I will be as brief as possible and I will try to lay this out clearly. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post!Background: I am going through rather a hard time at the moment. I had to take off work until September due to severe depression, which I have suffered with for about 7 years now. It came to a head last year, when my pretty horrible boyfriend of nearly a decade finally left me. This is the first time I have ever had to go on ""sick leave,"" and I hate it. I am so, so lucky that I have this option, but I still feel embarrassed and frustrated that it is come to this point. Problem: I have been seeing a psychologist and he always tells me to make friends. he is been harping on it for the last few weeks and this last Friday he gave it to me as my ""homework,"" for our next session. Truth be told I really, really want a good friend because I have never actually had one before. My problem is that I have already *tried* to make new friends, and it went horribly. Back in February he gave me a similar piece of ""homework,"" and I ended up emailing some people I know pretty well from work and church. I worked hard on the emails, personalized them, and I had really high hopes when I sent them out. Hopes which were dashed when nobody responded to any of the emails. I feel crazy admitting this, but this put me in a pretty horrible state for a while and really killed what was left of my self esteem. I honestly do not think I will ever be ready to do that again, because another rejection like that could actually kill me. I do, however, recognize that I have to pull myself back up and try again if I ever want to get better.Question: What is the safest way for a very sensitive, sad woman to make friends? Is there any way to reach out to people with less risk of rejection? All the mental health websites I can find recommend ""reaching out to people,"" or ""making friends"" but none of them tell me what to do in the event that nobody wants to be my friend. I am just really, really scared of being rejected again. What is the safest way for a very depressed woman to make new friends?",Depression

I do not know how to live an even semi-normal life when I am haunted by these things while I am awake and while I am asleep.I do not know how to get rid of the loneliness when making friends has been repeatedly unsuccessful and being a good partner to anyone is out of the question.

46616,"My Diagnosis is the worst thing to happen to me I was diagnosed a month ago after going in for a [TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation) consultation for what I thought was my life long clinical depression. The psychiatrist told me I was not a candidate because I was not depressed but had bipolar type 2. I got a second opinion and he also confirmed bipolar type 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I got my diagnosis, I've kinda gone off the deep end. On one side, I got an answer to my problem and a potential solution. But on the other side, I am now unable to see any part of me with any normalcy. Everything about me is now seen with discernment and that is causing me to lose my mind, so to speak. I don't want to call it a mental health crisis, but that's what it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27 and have obviously lived with this most of my life, but I always just thought I had depression that I was able to come in and out of depending on my lifestyle choices and I was probably a bit ADHD, loud, laughed too much etc... But now when I'm in a ""good"" mood, I just think I'm hypomanic.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor gave me a mood stabilizer that caused extremely vivid hallucinations and I was scared to sleep... I would stay up all night just because I knew I would wake up with crazy hallucinations - I saw my girlfriend turn into a wearwolf and bite my neck. CRAZY things like that...

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm depressed and it's hard for me to work, I keep having meltdowns and I don't know what to do... I'm fearing that this will ruin my career and even though I'm optimistic that I'll eventually find a drug that helps me, I don't know how much time I have to get stable. Why is this happening to me just because I got a diagnosis?

I do not wish to talk to people close to me about this matter because I do not want them to worry, nor do I want them to think I am being dramatic for attention. That is not the case. I know there is no clear answer to the one that I seek. I just want to know the most painless, easiest way of committing the act of suicide. I could be here all day giving you reasons as to why I want too and could read reasons as to why I should not all day long.

I just want to know some advice (theoretically) on what the quickest and easiest way of suicide would be. Without involving anybody else. Like I do not want someone to find my body, I want to just disappear forever. Without causing trauma to anybody who might find me in that state. The only way I can think of this being possible is by drowning and hoping the ocean takes me for good.

17383,"Hi guys, So I have been struggling with depression and PTSD since my father became an alcoholic. I had a pretty nice childhood, up until my dad got addicted and my mom got breastcancer twice. Luckily, she survived. My dad was a top banker, very successful, but his addiction got the best of him. He did absolutely horrible things. &amp;#x200B;So when I started my student time, I got really depressed. I could not make choices. I lived at home, being deeply depressed, whilst all of my friends moved out and I felt like I was so late with that. My friends convinced me to move in with them, but I said no, and now I regret that. Eventually I moved out and I had a good time, but I feel like I could have made so much more of my student time. And I did not do that. I know it was because I was struggling with PTSD, but I just do not understand myself and I feel like I have lost myself years ago, due to my traumatic childhood. &amp;#x200B;Apart from that, I told a lot of people the bad things my dad did, but I now also see that he is a good man. For some reason, I want to go back and tell people how good of a man he is and what he has achieved in his life- apart from his alcoholism. But I feel like people do not really care and this has more to do with my own process of moving on? &amp;#x200B;Anyways, I hope there is someone that can help me with some comforting words!

I’ve been dealing with bowel mouvements when facing a stressful event, which is, annoying but I deal with it. I rush to the toilets and I’m good.
I read that during a fight or flight episode, your body wants to removes its wastes. Be it. 

Problem is, a few hours later, I have to deal with severe cramps in my lower abdomen. I do not understand why I get that, and it’s pretty annoying since usually, the stressful events happen mid-day, and I get the cramps from 8pm to 5-6am. I can barely move, even breathing hurts. But I manage to fall asleep either way.

Yesterday, I had to deal with that /again/, and it was much stronger than usual. I felt like someone was stabbing my lower left area, every 3-4 minutes.

A new fear I also have is that I will faint when having blood drawn which has never happened before.

And he convinces me that there is something wrong with my thyroid from my Zoloft. I am just so frustrated because I want to rule everything out and make sure I know I am fine to get started on getting this dumb anxiety to go away. But I am scared.

It just does not feel worth the time to tell them. they will just get upset and probably try to get me to go to a mental hospital or another therapist but i do not have the patience for it. I doubt ill do anything on this trip but the thought is tempting. Even if i do enjoy myself and have fun though ill just go back home and go back to feeling empty and shit.

Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends, and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend, who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others, so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family, but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety, I sometimes do not take jokes very well, especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members, they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or, in rare cases, until I start crying. A lot of times, their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of ""I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of."" and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love, as well as mental heath topics, when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i'm here because i can't honestly tell if the situation im in is entirely in my head. Short background, in august 2018 .i had some fatigue, joint pain, intestinal issues and i had missed my period 2 months straight so i went to the dr and after bloodwork they determined i had hyperthyroidism and a positive ANA. They also found my sed rate to be elevated slightly and my CRP was around 7. 5 months of doctors visits, a loose diagnosis of thyroiditis (after my levels went from hyper to hypo), and then normalized blood work (back in normal range for thyroid and ANA). I basically get a clean bill of health, all my bloodwork looks good. Except my symptoms worsened. My anxiety and depression also got worse which is why im wondering if im just manifesting symptoms because of my mental health

&amp;#x200B;

The symptoms i had that were strongly associated with thyroid have mostly gone away except for the fatigue, but now new stuff is popping up. For the past month i've been having period problems, abdominal pain and gastro problems. 

I had a normal period in the last week of december, but then 2 weeks later i had 6 days straight of weird heavy spotting. throughout this time (technically since august actually) i was having diarrhea every morning without fail, and intermittent constipation. it came with abdominal cramping and severe nausea that goes away after i use the bathroom. I also completely lost my appetite and was having really strong nausea almost daily. I had stretches of days where i just couldn't bring myself to eat despite being super hungry, it just made my stomach turn. Despite eating less than i usually do, /and/ the fact that i usually lose weight really fast when restricting calories, I've been gaining weight and my stomach has grown so big i can barely fit into my pants. Shortness of breath has become a weird problem too. idk if its related. ive always been bad at breathing but i get winded getting off the bed to use the bathroom. laying down on my back makes me feel like i cant breath too.

Yesterday i went to the ER because since about 1/12 i've been getting really intense sharp/twisting pain in my lower left and lower right abdomen as well as a general dull ache right above my groin. The stabbing comes and goes, sometimes there will be 1-2 min stretches where it is extremely painful/waves of stabbing pain but then i wont feel it for another few hours. I recently looked down and realized the left side of my stomach is bulging out a little farther than the right side. Its hard to tell, as i have a softer stomach anyway. I was supposed to get my period on 1/25 i believe, but instead i had spotting the whole week and then on 1/28 during one of my classes i got horrific lower back pain and strong cramps. I had severe nausea and the pain was so bad i nearly cried. And yet, still only occasional light spotting. This is highly unusual for me as i usually have very light and painless periods with only moderate cramping *exactly* when i start bleeding. I took tons of painkillers and fell asleep but woke up in just as much pain and still hadnt started bleeding. So i went to the ER the next morning

They did an internal ultrasound, bloodwork and a urine test. The blood and urine came back mostly fine. They confirmed that my thyroid levels were normal, and my liver and kidneys are in good order. Lymphocytes are a bit low, globulin a bit high, and in the urine test they picked up some protein and blood but they assumed that was from traces of the spotting i was experiencing. The ultrasound found that my ovaries and uterus look ""unremarkable"". There were ""small follicles"" present, as well as evidence that a cyst may have ruptured on the right ovary and there was a small amount of free floating fluid. Shortly before i left, i started bleeding normally as well. I was surprised honestly. Looking down and seeing how bloated i am and feeling the immense pain on my left all the time, i really expected them to find something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in immense pain and i'm confused. This all set off alarm bells in my head. i tried to brush it off for a long time but the pain just got worse and worse. I'm gonna obviously wait out my period and see if the pain persists after. I have a CT scan scheduled (ordered by the dr on my campus, i had gone to her about the pain a few weeks before the er thing happened) for feb 9th but it costs $3k for me.. I don't want to waste the money if i wont find anything. I can't keep wasting money on medical bills that aren't helping me

right i started to feel worthless ever since i wa a teenager i had a hard fitting in with group of people i felt extremely shy and i saw that my best friend at the time could effortlessly blend in and have many friend it completely baffled me and it wa the first time that i started telling myself over and over i am not pretty i have no talent i am not smart i am worthless year old me cried myself to sleep convinced that people just simply didn t like me i could never quite figure out what wa defective in me everywhere i went i felt extremely awkward and felt in high school i started to feel immense academic pressure i saw that my classmate were very high achieving i didn t even want to think about my future and i spent much of my time last minute studying and playing video game instead of planning anything for my future i ended up not getting into college that i wanted to while my friend and classmate were accepted i accepted that i wa a failure compared to everyone in my high school a socially awkward talentless ugly failure i went to university i am now doing a master with an internship i graduated with summa cum laude for my undergraduate i wa still constantly cry and contemplating the worth of my pathetic life still i wa able to appear smart in front of my classmate i took up a research internship a well where i wa again told that i wa smart and had a lot of potential and other b but aside from school i didn t have much of a life any friend i made in uni have long been lost because people don t like being around a depressed person i wa made out to be toxic so that alone should tell you enough how awful it is to be around me i went to therapy it didn t do much i took medication it doesn t do much i have now entered my master program and i am being told by my supervisor that she ha serious doubt a to whether i will pas everyone else is enjoying their time in their study while i have to struggle so hard just to be told that i m not even good enough to get a passing grade i also struggle extremely badly with body dysmorphic disorder i have a pear shaped body no matter how much i exercise my leg just stay very bulky and thick i lost a lot of weight in my last year of my undergraduate study it wa partly because i hated my body but above all it wa because i hated my life so much that i wanted to make it visible by appearing sickly thin i continued to lose weight until i wa underweight only then do my leg appear normal i continued to follow disgusting anorexic eating pattern during my study it wa so damn hard to study while having to be pre occupied with food and having to only eat calorie in order to not gain weight somehow i passed all my damn exam after this year i admitted to my parent that i had an eating disorder although at this point it wa kind of evident i went home to take a gap year for the sake of my mental health during my gap year i sought professional treatment and of course i gained a ton of weight i wa so sick of living with severe depression and anorexia it wa near traumatic to see my body change so much in a short amount of time i felt extremely defective for gaining so much weight i can t believe my parent thought it would be a good idea for me to recover at home instead of at a ed treatment center because my emotional volatility were simply insane but i became physically healthy and i wa eating lot of good food i even got a part time job during my gap year to convince myself that i wa at least semi functional unfortunately a is the case with my pear shaped body living at a normal weight entail lot and lot of misery i can never wear skinny jean because my leg are ugly i can t stand the cellulite and belly fat that accompanies my healthy body i wa handed bad genetics in term of body build my body alone take away my will to live after my gap year i continued onto my master i started to lose some weight just because i slept through some snack and meal from fatigue and then i knew that i could never gain that weight back i started to take up lot of exercising to create more room for extra food the vast majority of my classmate are thin people being bigger than everyone is extremely triggering for me everyday i wake up and think about what i m going to eat then i think about how big my leg are then i think about how much thinner and smarter and classmate are then i see all the thin people around me then i think about what i m going to eat next then i think about how i m going to fit a jog or a boxing class into my busy schedule then maybe i will think about school and such then i go to sleep and repeat it all again i even lost my damn period again it s maddening because i am not even a thin person and yet my body think that being slightly thinner mean that i m necessarily dying i have such a dumb body now here i am doing an internship for school and i am failing very badly it s not in my native language and i haven t known the language for very long so it cost me twice the cognitive energy to follow everything apparently taking exam go smoothly but the minute i have to be in a practical setting i turn into a complete idiot i don t have the extra energy to put in the effort because most of my dumb thought are just my leg are fat her leg are thin she is lucky i have to worry about weight lunch is when jogging when extra squat when what s for dinner etc now i m constantly being told that i m not performing well and they can t tell if it s because of a language barrier or if i genuinely don t understand what is going on everyone else is doing just fine and they say that you have to be pretty stupid to fail at this internship well guess who s going to be that idiot who can t pas looking back at my life i just see failure and mediocracy and just a lot of sadness a i said earlier my body alone take away my will to live but in order to be able to function in school and work you need to stay relatively healthy but seeing a my life is just filled with social isolation inferiority complex and still lot of depression there is just simply no way that my life is worth it living in this healthy body make me extremely sad and the life that i would otherwise have without an ed is just not worth it it doesn t justify the effort i put into recovery and the effort i put in with learning to accept my body seeing a my life is just consisting of studying feeling stupid feeling incompetent cry exercising restrictive eating hunger fatigue and more cry i just wonder how the hell everyone else is just out here living a normal life without any mental illness people like my classmate are really out here acing their exam acing their internship having a life having lot of friend having a relationship having fun and leading overall fulfilling

This knowledge that my mind goes to this place so often always stays at the back of my mind and I am always acutely aware of it regardless of whatever else I am doing. I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too, although I would guess not. Because no one checks up on me and the one person that claims to care about me is pretty shitty and inconsistent, although she is the best I have got. I lost all my friends over a year ago and I know they all still talk about me from time to time, which I am not sure if I appreciate or not. In this past year I have met a handful of people, but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend, nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then. I think this is around where my problems start but I do not know that for certain either. I am currently living in the worst stage of my life so far and I do not know if I will make it out. I am 19 and only a few years ago I had a clear view of what I wanted my life to turn out like and where it was going to go. It almost feels like all those things are happening and that I am being left behind to build my own new path brick by brick, and I am all out if bricks. My head feels like a dull, dense boring grey rock with nothing going in or out and nothing ever changing. I do not have access to weapons in my country but if I had a gun in my home, I would point it under my chin without hesitation, and seriously consider stopping this mess right there and then. I just feel like my head is a big grey rock with no individuality or sensitivity",Depression

46991,"For those that have taken Lamictal, at what dosage did you start to feel relief of depressive symptoms? I'm transitioning from lithium+wellbutrin therapy to hopefully just standalone lamotrigine. The wellbutrin seemed to lose it's effectiveness after taking it for a few years and the lithium wasn't enough to prevent depressive symptoms. I'm starting to feel better regardless of medications, and have been taking 25mg lamotrigine for a week now. It's unfortunate it takes so long to get up to a therapeutic dose on this medication, but I know it's worth it to be patient.

Moved into a nice new home, but cannot even unbox the first thing. Going through a rough divorce, but I always said she was my light, and now without her I cannot see a reason to do anything. Nothing seems worth it anymore. Being in her presence made me a better person, made me feel I could do anything. Now I struggle to make it to the bedroom door every morning. For the last few months I have leaned heavily on my support group, but I can feel them stepping away as I overburdened them time and again. I am afraid to tell my therapist and I do not know why. Maybe I am afraid they will lock me up. All I know is I spent 27 years lost in the world before I met her, and then 7 years feeling like I had found heaven. Now I wish I could feel nothing. That would be an upgrade. I am just empty. So empty. I do not see how I can do this without her in my life. I thought moving out of our shared house would make things better. But it is 1000 times worse. I cannot keep feeling like this, but I do not see a way out. I need her. So badly. She was my everything. I even loved her flaws. Probably loved them most of all as that is what made her human. I do not know what to do. I just know I need her. I have to find a way to move on without her. But I cannot even imagine tomorrow in my head right now. To say the least of a future. I am so tired and so empty. And the world feels so dark. And I do not know what to do anymore.

16558,"Hello, I am seeking advice for my depression/addiction. Growing up, I was bullied until the end of high school and my strict religious parents created a very stressful and traumatic upbringing at home. I have always had an unshakeable feeling of low self worth and I always feel like nobody likes me. I always have to go above and beyond for people to like me but others seemingly do nothing and have people adore them. In addition, I have an over obsessive addiction to things that stimulate me. It ranges from food, movies/tv, theme parks, etc (no alcohol or drug addictions). Really, just anything that prevents me from sitting with myself and my thoughts. Literally, I cannot do anything without simultaneously eating a snack, or listening to music or a podcast or something to stimulate me and make me feel happy. I am addicted to this self induced false sense of happiness because its the only time I really ever feel happy. Over the years, I have made excuses/goals to help me with my depression and low self-esteem. First, I blamed it on my weight, then my lack of education, then my finances, then being single and alone, etc. Present day, I have my own place, I got fit, completed multiple degrees, have a great paying career, I am in a 6 year committed relationship, and I have even mended my strained relationship with my family. Honestly, I have a great life and I have run out of excuses. HOWEVER, my self worth is as low as ever and I still feel like people do not like me (or think the ones that do, will leave me the second I do something wrong or upset them). I have been seeing a therapist for 2 years and it has helped me to better understand the root of my behaviors but no luck finding a solution. I am continuously told to try positive affirmations but no matter how much I repeat to myself you are smart, you are worthy,etc, or how many lists i write with my positive traits, nothing changes. I am not suicidal or anything like that, and when I reflect, like I stated earlier, I am aware I have a great life but the thought of living the rest of my life and never being truly happy or loving myself is so scary and I do not know what to do.Anyone in a similar situation or have advice?

I'm currently undiagnosed (getting there.. why does it take so long to see a pysch?), but I had one of those ""oh shit, I was so crazy I convinced myself I wasn't crazy"" moments a few months ago after I checked myself into a psychiatric hospital in the middle of the night while going through a month of full blown mania without really realizing what it actually was. I didn't want to get hospitalized so I kinda lied my way out, Idk why. I probably shoulda gone but I just wanted to talk to someone and in the moment the idea of a hospital bed was the last thing I wanted. Feels fuckin bad man. I didn't ask for this shit. I really should have seen the signs earlier though. I was such a bright kid and then when I was like 16 I just dropped off the face of the earth. Or when I was 19 and I drank myself into a near coma and flipped my car 3 times and walked away without a scratch, or that time I dropped out of college suddenly to become a plumber after sleeping 16 hours a day for months,  or when I was drinking myself into blackout daily just to cope with the pain. 

 I am so very fortunate to have a wonderful girlfriend that cheers me up when I am down, but sometimes she gets upset when im ""away"". Sometime's I'm ice cold. I just check out from the world. Nothing gets in, and nothing gets out. It's like an emotional hostage situation. It might be for a day, it might be for a week, but I'm just gone. I just get so wrapped up in all of my racing thoughts. They kill me. I suffered from some serious childhood abuse so I often flashback into those memories (definitely have a ptsd diagnosis coming as well) and then before I know it, it's an hour later and my already shitty mood is just shot to oblivion. I am so. fucking. depressed.

 I've moved to a new city a year and a half ago and I don't have a single friend in my area besides roommates/girlfriend. Honestly, it scares me to talk to anyone I haven't known for years at this point. My desire to engage in friendships is shot. I would honestly rather fuck off in my room and work on my projects all day and night. Sometimes I feel like code is the only thing in this world that makes sense. It just is, or it isn't. There's no grey. And that brings me to the next thing...

Ever since I realized that there is actually something wrong with my head, I have been lower than low. I pride myself in my mind and my work. I refuse to be limited.  I just can't accept that for some months of the year (when I'm low), my critical thinking is shot. It makes me feel so fucking useless. And somehow, despite all of this, I am doing relatively well for myself. So there's that I guess. I do seriously wonder how long I'll be able to keep this up. I just can't really help but feel that there is just no fucking point to anything anymore besides my work. I don't feel as if I could ever possibly achieve happiness, so I spend my time working towards some stupid never ending monetary goal. In mania, I have a hard time discerning what is real. The one thing that I can understand is that money is the only god, and with enough money you can do anything. So I pursue this because it is a constant, providing stability above all else. If I could fuck off to some island with my girlfriend and enough books/a working computer, I don't think I'd ever come back. I feel different. I'm losing my ability to blend in. I just act.. very eccentric to put it in a good way. And I feel like its becoming noticeable. 

I guess that's the end of my ramble. I feel embarrassed when I open up like this. Sometimes I find it hard to believe there are people just like me who are struggling just as much..... It's a lonely world.",Bipolar

I understand the good and bad, those clinical dead patients you hear about how that was the greatest moment ""clich"", I want that experience so much. My relationship is not great and I cannot even begin to describe what is exactly onmy plate. This is kind of how I feel in a point blank sense: it is a waste of time to talk to a professional because it is just advice, what they could tell me or what anyone could tell me is kind like.. yeah I know.

51287,"Old Friendships Past Due Date? I'm pretty much completely alone. My family is mostly dead and the rest no contact. I'm f(42) divorced, no kids, and I just ended a three year post marriage relationship that was pretty toxic. 

I have two best friends since High School. We've known each other over 25 years and we used to be inseparable. (We all had family issues so we became our own family.) They both moved out of state at least 15 years ago so the majority of our friendship is on the phone and we maybe visit each other once or twice a year. 

My last relationship which lasted three years, really got in the way of our friendships. My boyfriend was so clingy I could never call my friends because he wouldn't leave me alone for a minute. (That's a whole other unhealthy issue I can't get into. Lol).  But as an avoidant person it drove me crazy. Anytime I had the chance to be alone without my boyfriend the last thing I wanted to do was call my friends. I needed alone time. 

I did try to break up with him several times. He even moved out a few times but kept coming back. I finally broke up with him for good about six months ago. 

Anyway, I understand why they are reluctant to just go back to the way things were in our friendship. I don't blame them for being upset with me and I fully plan to try my best to make it up to them and I'm grateful that they are willing to talk to me at all but... I'm not sure I like them anymore. 

We've been friends for so long. I seriously don't have anyone else in my life and I am afraid I am just doing the avoidant thing and looking for reasons to write them out of my life. I've done that with everyone else in my life but these two always seemed special and I feel like we've known each other so long they are family and I want to always know them but they aren't really being good friends anymore. 

I know people grow apart and I admit that I am the one who stopped talking as much initially and like I said I was and am more than prepared to make up to them the fact that I haven't been around but honestly I wasn't around because I was in a toxic relationship and I told them that every time I did get a chance to talk to them. I talked about how I was stuck for financial reasons and covid and that I was losing my mind to never be alone and they didn't help me. They didn't encourage me to get out or give me advice they just got more and more distant and now that I am broken up they tell me this guy was bad for me but they wouldn't tell me that when we were together and that's what I needed to hear from them. Instead they just acted like they liked my bf and talked bad about both of us to each other. I hate to say but it almost feels like they were enjoying me being in a bad relationship. Maybe I'm just paranoid. 

They say they forgive me but they don't talk to me very much. One really doesn't call me or answer me and the other calls all the time but I'm not allowed to talk about my relationship at all. He has hung up on me twice for even mentioning it. I get that he doesn't like my ex but neither do I and I was in a toxic relationship for three years, I need to talk some of it through. I would never do that to them and god knows I have had to listen to some boring and/or stupid problems of theirs repeatedly over the years. Why can't they do that for me?

I know people out grow each other. They have made new friends and I need to as well but it's hard for me because  well, I have avpd. 

Ideally, I would like to keep them as friends and make new friends that understand more about the person I am now instead of the person I was in high school. But the part of me that pushes people away wants to push them out and I don't know what to do?

Do they get to treat me bad because I wasn't as accessible to them for a while? I was never completely gone I just couldn't be there as much. Do they get points for being friends with me so long? Should I just over look it?

Or am I right that they are being disrespectful by telling me what I can or can't talk about, hanging up on me if I mention something they don't like, talking to each other and excluding me even if they are talking about coming into town and staying with me even when they are not invited? I have to work and they are on vacation but please come stay at my house and expect me to drop everything to do what you want? (We never do what I want when they come to visit because I live here so I have to be on board to do everything they want to do.)

I know it's a long story. There is a lot more to it too but am I blowing things out of proportion and prematurely ending my longest and only friendships ? Or has the time apart from them given me clarity to see who they really are which is bossy and disrespectful of me and I should just try and make new friends that don't judge me so harshly, like talking and listening to me, and actually live in my town? 
TLDR: I have had a hard life and I want to stand up for myself. But it's leaving me completely alone. Am I cutting out my friends too quickly?",Personality disorder

I'm also scared the cancer is already in my bones/spine, as my back often hurts and I can feel some kind of ""dent"" in my spine. 

I'm also diagnosed with severe anxiety (duh), so sometimes it's hard to tell which symptoms are real :( For example my fiancee tells this ""dent"" in my spine it's just my muscles contracting because of my anxiety. The same can be said about diarrhea, fatigue... But then again, how do I know when it's anxiety and when it's real?

I know I should just wait for the colonoscopy in 4 weeks, but I can't function properly right now. I've made mistake and visited a forum for colon cancer survivors and not only they all have symptoms similar to mine, but lot of them were very young, like me. 

My doctor told me it's probably IBS and hemorrhoids, but my mom had colon cancer at 50 and I've read it's getting more and more common in young people and here I am, crying myself to sleep every night, because I'm convinced I'm dying. What should I do?",Anxiety
19988,"I do not use reddit at all but I just wanted to share what I am going through and hopefully someone can take time to read this and reply because I do need some type of support from another person. I am 19 and I have always had underlying issues like anxiety or this impending sadness that I have always pushed to the side growing up as a teen because my parents have never even talked about mental health. I even was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid but my mom has a huge stigma on mental health and told the doctors I am just a kid. I thought it was normal that growing up I would get extremely nervous before doing anything/simple tasks. I also would get distracted so easily and was never able to sit down and do work at school/home. My mom was also emotionally abusive at times and would rarely hit me but when she did its over things that she should not be putting her hands on me for. Thinking about it high school was a dark time for me but at the time I did not feel that bad about it until it caught up to me after i graduated. My mom is a great mother but she has never listened to my opinion and has always kept me in a box. She was a helicopter mom checking what I do all the time and this led me to have little to no social life in high school. Also my highschool was so sick and twisted I could go into a whole other post about it. I kept telling my mom to take me out of that school but of course she never listened and forced me to go to a school with only about 200-300 students. The students all acted way younger than there age. The seniors would act like 6th graders and it was just such a weird and confusing environment. I am very angry at my mom but I do love her immensely so When I turned 18 that is when a lot of my issues caught up with me. I was unhappy and unable to even speak to people. My anxiety became worse when i would start shaking before even speaking to somebody. I started to notice that the friends and the people i knew at the time are not what I am looking for in friends. I do not know if that is my depression making me think all my friends are not people i want to be around but regardelsss i pushed everyone away. While going through such a horrible phase my 18 year was hell. My mom thought i was changing and being cold when in reality i was just really really down. She made me feel bad for the way i was feeling and still does till this day. I had no social life or any friends because i pushed everyone away. One positive about my 18 year is i finally found my passion but i wish i discovered myself earlier. I also have zero idea how to start. Now I am 19 and my anxiety and depression have become debilitating. I quit my job and I am in my room all the time with no contact with ppl besides my online friends (i was in my room all the time in high school too). I have now become distant to my family and i feel so distant from everybody. I have daily intrusive and very sad thoughts 24/7. I am already getting therapy but i feel so bad at times. I right now cannot imagine myself having a job or going to college. It almost seems impossible to me. I Also judge people so much and think that I am above others in my head but i truly know its because I am unhappy with myself. my mom is extremely judgmental too so its hard for me to do things i like without her judging me. I just need someone to talk to, Ill try to reply but i might forget i even wrote this post or be too nervous to reply. I need advice about my my mental health,social life, what I am interested in, and about my old friends in which i pushed away out of both my own choice and my mental health. I do not know where to get started. Just need to speak about what I am going through (Long post)",Depression

47704,"I think my brother is depressed and I'm unsure what to do. Any advice or suggestions on what I should do? He's 19, dropped out of college because he have no passion in anything. He hates learning and have no friends. He's always in his room and refuse to leave. He would lock his door and turn off the lights. When my parents asked him if he wants to go somewhere he just screamed no repeatedly at them. Sometimes when we come back home and I check up on him, he told me he regretted it and said he's a horrible person.

I suggested him to get professional help. I'm also seeing a therapist to try to better myself. But my brother told me it's a waste of time and he doesn't want to talk about his feelings. All he does is play pc games from morning to night. Even till 3 am. My mom comes home from her night shift and when she saw that he's still awake they started a screaming match. Their loud voices would wake me up and I try to stop them and it never works.

Now I just check up on him and try to have a decent conversation with him. I would talk about video games with him or other things he's interested. But most of the time he yells at me to leave his room.

I think he has a lot of pressure from my mom. She wants him to go to college in the medical or engineer field. It might be partially my fault too. My mom wanted me to be a nurse but I got a degree in art. Even my relatives told me ""you can't have 2 siblings in the creative field. There has to be a balance. Your brother should be in stem."" I asked my brother and he actually wants to be a writer. I feel bad, I don't think I'm a good older sister (I'm 25). I focused on my own issues for a long time now. I also tried defending him against my family but he told me to stop. My brother ended up yelling at me that I'm a failure because it took me 6 years to graduate, got a useless degree and tons of job rejections. So he doesn't want to take any advice from me about college. He always tells me this when he wants to be alone because I ended up crying to my room or the bathroom.",Depression

My job has become redundant but I do not wish to change as I do not think any other job is going to be better than the one I have. I cannot hang out with my close group of friends as they are either getting married or are in a serious relationship. Cannot socialize anywhere else due to the restrictions brought about by the pandemic. To prevent feeling lonely, I hang out with a group of people who are at least 5-7 years younger to me. But deep down, I feel out of place as they are in a different phase of life and have different interests. No other interests or hobbies. All this makes me lose interest in my life further.For a while I thought I was under a depression as this feeling of nothingness came on suddenly. I convinced myself that the depression is the reason my life is at a low point.But, recently I met a person who was diagnosed with clinical depression. That is when I realised what depression actually is. Compared to what the guy was facing, my life was a picnic. I had no problem in functioning and going about my daily life. For a brief moment I was relieved that I was not under depression.However, then the realisation hit me, ""If I am not depressed, then there is only one explanation for this funk in my life: I am just pathetic"". Ironically, this realisation of being a pathetic loser made me feel worse than when I thought I was depressed. At least, when I was depressed I could go to a psychologist and get myself treated. Being pathetic has no solution. It is just the way I am....If any of you are wondering about relationships..I have never had any. Not a single one. It is difficult for me to even maintain good relations with family members. I do not know how to read and react to social situations. All this while my justification for the lack of social skills was due to having Asperger's or some other autism.

Because of how ""loose"" it was down there I became more aware of my testicles and would reach down there more often. Anyways, because I was constantly reaching down there I became paranoid about my testicles. 

I should also note that I was a frequent fapper (like 3-4 times a day) and decided to stop that. So I would go nofap for 2 days and then have a go at it once the next day. Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it. I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little ""pinch"" on my left testicle. It didn't hurt or anything it was just... uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia!!

I haven't felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again.  I always constantly reach down there feeling them, and thinking omg one is bigger than the other! omg one feels softer than the other! I'm dying!

This mental hospital stay was right after the start of my first period. Over the years that I was medicated I took Lamictal, Prozac, Buproprian, and Lithium. They didn't do much except harm my memory and turn my into a zombie. However, I never had many of the Bipolar symptoms to begin with. Just mood swings and a lot of PTSD related trauma behaviors. At the age of 18 I took myself off of them and almost three years later I have still not had a manic episode. However, in the past few months I have noticed a pattern where my depression, negative thoughts, and unstoppable crying (among other things) come about a week before my period and disappear almost as soon as my period arrives. I am not sure if this is important but, my mom who was given a Bipolar diagnosis that was later retracted also experienced similar pre-period symptoms. I would like to be treated for my possible PMDD however my psychiatrist is worried that potentially treating my PMDD with Prozac could reactivate any latent Bipolar Disorder. I was just wondering how often Bipolar and PMDD are misdiagnosed as one or the other and if you guys ever were misdiagnosed? How did treatment go for you? What do you use to treat your PMDD? What is your opinion on this matter as well? I don't have a lot of friends who understand this kind of thing and I want an outside opinion before I start something potentially damaging.",Bipolar

24579,"A bit of context, I am FtM transgender and in the closet.Over the past few weeks I have been growing more and more depressed and dysphoric, leading up to a break down. As much as Id like to say I am typically stable, this happens every few months, and just like last time, I did it in front of my friend. The two main things that caused this to happen was my realization that I am not happy, I have not been happy in a long time, and that I cannot be happy as a girl. (Part of this hit me when I had a vivid dream where I discovered that I was not a biological female, and everyone just accepted that. I did not need to come out, I did not need to explain or justify myself, I was just genuinely happy.)I texted my friends yesterday saying that I am not going to be active in our group chat because I am close to snapping, and they found this really funny and wanted me to go on a depressed and manic rant (something I have been known to do very well when I am like this). This pissed me off because its clear that they do not actually care about my well-being, and that they just want me to say something funny. Because I was so isolated and left alone with my thoughts, I started harming myself. I was clean for months but the stress of everything made me relapse. Shortly after this I texted my best friend telling him everything that happened and how alone I am. Hes cisgender and is not depressed, so he does not understand what I am feeling, but hes always there for me. I was crying while texting him, telling him everything I did and everything I was feeling. He did not know how to react, and it was clear that he was just concerned, but he just stayed with me. He said that he did not know how to help, and I said that just being here and making sure I am not alone is helping a lot. I told him that I was afraid of going to sleep, because I cannot handle having another dream where I am happy just to be met with my miserable reality. He stayed up with me until 1:30, when he told me I need to sleep and that he will not let me destroy myself by staying awake all night like I wanted.It took an hour for me to fall asleep after that, the entire time all I wanted do was harm myself again, it was the only thought going through my mind and its still the only thought in my head. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my best friend being happy to hear that I stopped, so I have not done it for him. I broke down in front of my friend (tw self harm)",Depression

I need to mention I am using the common medications for hair loss, and though I have had nice results for some time, my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.I am so lonley, have no social life since I am ashamed to go outside, have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman, and it is all because of this malicious curse. I would trade absolutely everything I have to have a normal head of hair, like a guy my age should have. I would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. I know the hair is not my only problem, but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.I was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as I am still trying to fight for my life, hopeful to make an appointment, and although the guy there said it is still too early for me (does not mean It looks anywhere near decent) he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when I had last visited the clinic, and I looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what I have now. In fact, I was once a pretty handsome guy (though never appreciated it), but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old, sad and ugly to a point of no return.In that point of time it really does not matter whether I actually end my life or not, because I feel like I am already dead. Actually, I do not even feel like I am human anymore, just a pathetic, useless piece of rubbish. Having ""better days"" is actually the worst thing, because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse.

I spend hours practicing guitar and I hardly get anywhere. I learn a song and practice it for weeks only to discover I am still to anxious to play in front of my closest friends. I still do not have the muscle memory that I keep plucking painfully at the guitar to get. If I were to do instead of think, I would be dead. I would have killed myself because that is what I want to do half the time. I hate it when people give me this advice because for those neurotypicals, they do not understand the horrible things that go through my mind constantly, and all the horrible things I would have done if I just did things without thinking.

In the last few months I thought about what would I do if something happened to my parents-well probably die right after. The reality hit me like a truck with the death of their father, which showed me the reality. I am basically living for my parents, this would be terrifying to me because besides them no one cares about me, and I do not have anyone else who I care about. I am now 18 years old and horrified of life, the main thing why is because I cannot live with myself.

Instead of doing this shit which does not do anything for anyone, I should sacrifice myself for others, go work and be helpful- maybe not like Ghandi or mother Teresa- but a similar kind of helpful.

I am not a person, just a vessel filled with contradicting emotions- I am empty, without an identity even tho I have searched for it my whole teenage life. I never had ambitions nor future plans besides killing myself when I am 18 (In my dreams I did have ideas for the future but I saw them as unreachable and gaved them up, leaving them in my head instead of making them reality ).. well technically I am *dead* inside now. I cannot cry or shout at someone else but I was always the one who was shouted at- they were right I am a piece of shit I am not going to lie and pretend otherwise but it still hurts because I am trying to be good but always do something wrong,I am so fucking stupid and pathetic, I am a bad person naturally and suck at even being a decent person. I felt so guilty because of my behaviour that I did not went to school for about 6 months, made a lot of trouble etc. and all that just so I could punish myself and provoke myself to finally attempt suicide. Obviously no one knows that and they also do not care. You know what is also fucking gross about me,its going to be embarrassing but in my teenage years (12-16/17) I was unhealthy obsessed with love. I am not a person that has a lot of crushes, I have had just a few, three to be more specific. I hate myself for that but my obsessive behaviour was disgusting and embarrassing. Basically I always had a long crush on someone, the longest was for about three years. Instead of doing what most do, going to your crush after idk one month asking them out or befriending them, I stalked them on social media etc. which seems fine to most, but I also tried to meet this person in town and purposefully went where I thought they might be. Next to that I was in a delsuion that this person will rescue me. You see shit like that in skins as example where the infamous effy had two guys trying to help her and ""rescue"" her. I was not inspired by movies or shows, its more like that this unhealthy attachment stamps from everyone hating or ignoring me, that is why I assumed that this person could save me from my normal life. This particular person was the only one who cared even tho I was not friends with them. Heck, my friends cared less about me than this person who seemed genuinely concerned about me. I did not like the person at first and did not even bother to be friendly with them but after seeing how they cared I could not resist and developed feelings, I started to crave for this persons attention and love. I was (and partly still am) to some extend obsessed with my emotions which made (makes) me behave like an narcissist ( maybe I am one). My emotions ruled my life, nothing mattered but this person, because in my eyes I *loved* them, this *love* filled the void that my self hatred created. I wanted so badly that they rescue me from this life. that is where my obsession came from. I hate my personality, and I also happened to be ugly and dumb lol such a waste of air. Yes I am a plain Jane, I hope I will look better, because even tho I am empty inside, but if my vessel ever becomes pretty than people will not annoy me(negative harrassment like bullying) anymore.

25702,"I apologize if my English writing is unclear. This is a bit of a rant. I have been very miserable for a very long time, at least in relation to how long I have been alive (16). My earliest memories of wanting to die was when I was 11ish, and it has not improved since. I find it very hard to find and keep close friends and I have no close relationship with my family. My parents are extremely socially conservative and do not take mental health seriously. My brother tried to commit suicide back in 2019 and even then they treated it as a ""mindset issue"". I cannot go to him or any of my other siblings because I do not have that type of relationship with them. We were pitted against each other at a very young age and the resentment is still there. It feels like getting professional mental health treatment is out of the question while I am living with my family, they do not even like to take me to the doctor. I do not feel like I have a future. For the past 2 months I have lay in my bed and felt miserable because I have been too afraid to get a job, or apply to things I need to apply to, or practice and get better at my one real extracurricular (fencing). I do nothing and I tell myself it does not matter because I am not going to reach the future anyways because I am going to commit suicide. But, I know I do not have the courage to do so, but I do not have the courage to fix my life either. When school starts in about 3 weeks I know I am going to have completely fucked myself over because in my school you are required to have a current resume, and they expect it to be constantly changing and evolving and I have nothing. I have done nothing in the past year and nothing to show. In addition, I enrolled to be in an internship program in which I can intern with local legal firms (police or lawyer), but I have not been even trying to contact these places. I have not because I am too afraid to call them when I cannot email, and none of the places I emailed have responded (from a month ago).The one extracurricular I have (fencing) I am not even good at, because I started in late October of last year and in comparison to my peers, all high level ranked, I am a joke. I started too late. I have no skills I am good at, because my parents generally ignored me for my siblings (who all succeed in the sports and arts they choose to do) and encouraged little from me. So I did nothing because I had no passion for anything.I cannot even leave my house and do the one thing I love to do anymore. I used to love to go on walks in nature but I cannot anymore. I hate going outside and feeling inferior to everyone. I do not even know why at this point. I cannot even admit to myself how bad I feel. Every time I do I cannot help but minimize my own problems. I cannot help but feel like there is no reason for me to feel as bad as I do ( I am middle class and have both parents in the picture). I cannot help but think everything I am listing is just stupid melodramatic teenage bull and its not worth hurting myself over (which it prolly is not). But it still just hurts my heart so much. I hate feeling like I am a waste of potential. I hate feeling like it is over. I am still very young. But I compare myself to my peers and my own family and I see nothing but cowardice and a waste. I want my parents and family to be proud of me so much. But I know this is unlikely. In addition to the lack of accomplishments, I am bisexual and my conservative parents (as mentioned above) would never accept me if they knew. I hate having to hide myself and I know if they ever found out they would tell me I am confused and a faker and a liar. Or, they would get rid of me completely.I am so afraid of the future and I am so afraid because I am going to have to reach it alone. I do not have any friends or family. The only person who has ever been proud of me is my fencing coach, but I do not know what he sees in me. I hate showing my face around our academy because I am so afraid of disappointing him.

So I am officially diagnosed with it but most people on the internet and also my therapist say that it is likely because of a childhood of abusive/narcissistic or in any other way bad parents that resulted in this condition. But I don’t think that it comes from that. I couldn’t have had better parents or family; they supported me, respected my opinion and so on. I have the feeling that I always was like that even in kindergarten back then. The only thing odd about my parents was that they divorced as I was 6 years old (but I guess that’s not the most uncommon thing) and that my father is also very socially avoidant. Could it also be the latter (like in a „learned“ behavior?) or do you think it is more likely that it was something in the past that I just forgot and don’t remember / don’t think is significant enough?
Often I (ironically) feel a bit isolated when I see comments on YouTube or Reddit talking about the reason for the AvPD because I can’t relate at all to their stories (thankfully tho, but you know what I mean)",Personality disorder

14631,"I am curious if anyone here has experienced a ""fall from grace"" (apologies if this is not the most correct term) specifically you became the best (or highly skilled) at something in your life, but due to whatever circumstance, you are now no longer able to do that thing.A couple examples as it relates to me would be Michael Phelps or Dominique Dawes, olympic athletes who competed at an extremely high level, and basically devoted their entire lives to becoming the best at their chosen thing (or happened to become the best through their drive/passionate). Both of them are no longer able to compete at those levels anymore, and have stated in interviews that they suffer(ed) from deep depression for a multitude of reasons. What I gather one of the largest reasons is, is that they wrapped their entire identities around what they did, yet now that they lead more of a normal (possibly even mundane) life, there is a lost sense of self, and potentially nothing else could ever compare to their accomplishments / life long love / pursuits. I am asking this, as I have lived this life (non-olympic), and have felt the same way as the both of them for many years. The problem is that I have not met anyone else personally who is experienced this (which is why I am asking), and it is just as isolating as the quote ""it is lonely at the top"". What I specifically struggle with now (for many years), is once you have experienced a joy, fulfillment, and/or accomplishment on such a high level, the pursuit of any other endeavor seems almost meaningless. Of course one could hope to strike lightning twice, yet your ""first love"" (ie. the thing that you did), seems to always outweigh what anything else *could* be (at least for me). there is also a potential guilt I subconsciously feel about *truly* choosing to move on to something else.

46453,"Am I bipolar? tldr; got a diagnosis for bipolar as I was incredibly agitated and restless after a bad reaction to some medication and hospitalized as a manic episode. However I didn't feel elated and I was lucid. Is this bipolar or should I get a second opinion. I'm 31 years old and male.

Apologies for the essay.

Basically my story starts when I was very depressed and anxious for most of my adult life, and medication and therapy didn't do anything to really help. I tried Zoloft one day after the recommendation of my Dr. I woke up in the middle of the night all the time in a panic and couldn't think straight and after a week I was so restless I had to go to hospital. The attending Dr at the hospital said that it is a common reaction to medication if you're bipolar, and prescribed me Olanzapine.

After 2 months I hated the medication as it made me so sleepy and gain weight. So I decided to stop as I didn't need this before for 31 years. I was also prescribed Klonopin. I stopped Olanzapine and became very restless but I could deal with it with the Klonopin and I took it for 2 weeks. I remember the first day I stopped and I felt amazing though, like fully focused and full of positive energy to do things. However, one day I forgot to take Klonopin and it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I spent the next month waking up in the middle of the night in panic, feeling super restless in the morning and struggling to focus on anything.

I came off the Klonopin after that bad experience (but slowly tapered, I learned my lesson from the Olanzapine not to come of medication too quickly). I also got some Trazadone for sleep since I couldn't sleep for the whole night and would wake up in a panic and also couldn't get back to sleep despite feeling tired. As time went on, over the course of 3 months, I stopped having the panic attacks in the night, but would wake up super early really restless but exhausted. I also started to have depersonalization and had this spaced out feeling a lot of the time, and I would sort of feel like I was looked at myself in the third person. This carried on and didn't get better with time over the course of a few months.

Around thanksgiving I got really drunk, and after then, the restlessness became unbearable. I was also super emotional and couldn't focus. But I was fully aware of everything, and I didn't do anything reckless, and I didn't feel elated or anything. I basically tried to stick it out but couldn't take it, and went to hospital and they put me in a psychiatric ward as I was so agitated and restless and it was then they told me they thought I was bipolar and put me on Olanzapine again.

I've stuck it out for a few months, and to be fair, after two weeks of taking Olanzapine and Depakote, I started to feel much less restless and I was able to sleep fully. Also, the spaced out feeling subsided and started to feel myself again. However, the medication has left me super sleepy and it's affecting my work. With my psychiatrist's help we're going to lower the medication dose, but after that reduction, I'm feeling a bit spaced out, but less so than I was before. I'm still super sleepy though.

Basically I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and I kind of feel like I've been put in a bipolar box in terms of a diagnosis, but when I look at classic bipolar behavior, I don't really see it in myself? Has anyone else experienced anything like me? Like severe agitation, inability to sleep and depersonalization, but also being lucid, not engaging in reckless behavior and not having an elated mood?

34530,"Physical with Family Friend :/ Hey guys! So, this is pretty awkward, but I don't know where else to turn.

I'm a 23 year old man with severe insecurity about my body. Long story short, I was recently accepted into a Nursing Program at a local college. Part of the admissions process involves a physical exam. 

I enlisted in the Army at 18 and had a physical at MEPS, but the doctor was an old man, so it didn't matter much. This time, however, the physical will be at a local clinic due to my lack of insurance. 

The doctor and the practitioners that work in his practice are all old family friends. (Like, since I was about 6) I'm extremely nervous because I'm afraid the physical will make things weird around these people. 

I know logically that they're all skilled medical care providers and can surely separate personal and professional lives well, but I'm still a little embarrassed. Does anyone have some advice? 😅",Anxiety

My urge is strong, stronger than it is ever been, I feel hopeless and unable to get help, but I have also failed enough in life and the last thing I want to do is fail at ending it too.I used the Lifeline Chat, and I know some people have had bad experiences with both the hotline and the chat, but I do think the person I got was trying to help as best they could, and maybe I will try to use the resources they presented me with to try and get on the road to recovery, I just do not know what that road even is anymore nor where it might take me.I guess the Sticky Notes version of my life is: Grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family. Mom died young, after I graduated, and it messed me up, Dad developed Dementia and I was essentially forced to take care of him with little support until I finally broke down and he had to go to a nursing home. Pretty isolated from the rest of the family with few remaining friends.

Unfortunately in the 4 or 5 days ago my head has gone cloudy and I feel agitated i did have some mania as well i was just starting to get some relief to after  a major 5 month long episode also RLS is back which was caused by trying to start a drug called latuda which was 2 months ago

26769,"Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I am leaving. I have no closure and still do not even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I am a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just do not have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I do not spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I have stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I had not done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cannot even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just do not understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

I'm a (22 female) and my job is reporting and introducing new stores and foods on TV. It's creative and fun but because of the unstable income my mother doesn't support me.

I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say ""Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself""  It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her, however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there. I don't let that get in the way with work though.


Anyway. Today this random stranger during my break time came up to me and looked directly into my eyes and said

 ""You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.""

She kept holding my shoulders and gently rubbing them and I have no clue if this is hypnosis

 ""I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good people""

And little by little the weight in my shoulders started to get lighter. And it felt fuzzy. I had this feeling why does she know my family? Can she read me? Am I readable? Is my aura out? I'm about to panic! Then I just burst into tears and had to control myself to do the next reporting.

It was such a confusing experience because she was smiley nice in her 50s lady. 

Can someone tell me if she was a hypnotist or if she can see my soul or some angels or if she was just an empath that knew I was extremely stressed and wanted to let me know I was stressed.

51788,"This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do, could have been done better, and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student, I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now, during my clinical rotations, every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged, and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve.
 I am always reserved and quiet, and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option, fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However, this has backfired on me, as I struggle to form connections and networks, losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually, people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible, which makes me feel hopeless. 
What can I do to sustain balance, at least in my mind? In addition to this, I am lonely, and the effect on my already-damaged mental health is apparent. 
Last year, I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable, and I felt liked. But, in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group, I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable, whether I had anything interesting to say, and whether they looked down on me. The gut-wrenching anxiety became too much to bear, and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media, I see how new people have joined the group, formed close friendships, and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.
I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships, sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this ""mysterious aura"" around me, but after a few more dates, I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper, I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So, it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.

46686,"Has CBD made anyone here /worse/? I’ve been smoking weed really heavily for a few months, and during my last manic episode it was giving me symptoms of psychosis like hearing voices and eventually started giving me 3 hour long panic attacks where I’m /convinced/ I’m dying. I finally decided to quit weed and threw all my weed out. I bought CBD oil at a hippy grocery store here and decided to try that since it’s literally proven to not make you intoxicated, calm anxiety, and there’s even studies showing it to be an antipsychotic. 

Last night I took it for the first time and I did feel great for the first hour or so. I was estatic that I finally found something that can help me sleep with out making me psychotic. Until I ended up having another panic attack. I became very anxious that every little ache I felt or inch I felt was a sign that I was going to drop dead from cancer anytime soon. I was shaking so hard and would stand up to do something but become so distracted that I’d just walk back and forth a few times and then lay back down in bed. I even heard voices like I usually do when I get really high on strong sativa. I honestly, definitely felt high, and CBD isn’t supposed to make you high at all! It’s just supposed to be like a muscle relaxer. 

I’m honestly so confused about why I had this reaction. I’m not manic anymore, I have definitely crashed into depression and have been depressed for a week or so now. The fact that I’m not manic and *supposedly* wasn’t high when this ‘panic attack’ happened is really concerning to me? Especially because I was still hearing voices? (I say *supposedly* because since there’s not any regulation laws on CBD, technically the manufacturer could leave traces of THC in it and not tell you, so I guess theoretically I could have been high. But I bought really expensive CBD from a really reputable store, so I’m hesitant to think that it would be spiked with THC)

I don’t have any of these symptoms during the day when I’m completely sober. I thought CBD was safe, everyone says it calms you down and relaxes you. Why tf did I have the opposite reaction? What are your experiences with CBD?",Bipolar

35495,"I’m convinced I have a urethral stricture In may of last year I had a type of explosion in my bladder. It came with an insane feeling of urgency, frequency and a feeling that my
Bladder was in the grip of a vice. I also had an electrical type feeling in my bladder and Perineum.

I saw a urologist who thought I had a urethral stricture. I was sent for a cystoscopy that showed everything was ok. That was in September 2018. 3 months later the urgency and frequency decreased but then what accompanied was pelvic pain, tailbone pain, I had to start sitting down to urinate and I had to start milking my urethra to empty it - at this time I was also tapering from 6mgs of clonazepam. I hit 2mgs when this started. I finished my taper on clonazepam in the middle of February.

I now have all of those symptoms but they’re at full force now. For the past two weeks I had a slight burn at the end of urination. Peeing didn’t hurt but at the end I had a sharp/burn pain in a specific area in the top of my penis/urethra. 

For the past two weeks I’ve had a feeling that there’s a marble stuck in my urethra. Sometimes I can feel pressure in my urethra when I move about. Sometimes I get a sharp stabbing pain down my urethra too. The side of my penis hurts too.  I
Also have to gently milk my urethra to get the rest of the urine out. 

My fear is that the cystoscopy has caused a stricture. It’s done the very thing that it was supposed to rule out. There was no blood after it was done, nor did it burn when I peed, but the tip of my penis was very swollen for an
Hour or so. Apparently it’s extremely rare for someone to get a stricture from a routine cystoscopy, especially in the area I think mine is. But I’m 100% convinced that I have one. It’s making me very ill. 

I see the urologist in 5 days time. I’m in a chronic pelvic pain support group and apparently this is a very common symptom. But other guys have the same symptoms and have a stricture. 

I don’t want another cystoscopy but I’m guessing I’ll have to have one as it’s the only way to treat a stricture. I can’t believe I’m in this mess. I’m so upset and frustrated. ",Anxiety

Only meds I've tried is low grade anxiety meds. And I'm unsure what bloods. My doc ran more thursday, said he'd call if anything was different. They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. 
And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. I am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain, dizziness, headaches and heart discomfort . The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .
It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm, which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram, several EKGs from the ER visits, an MRI 3 months ago no contrast, a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month, a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. 
I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability, anxiety, and maybe clogged artery issues. With the ICP he thought, which is phesable I have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head CTs and the MRI showing no pressure(doesn't rule it out) and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and I've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally.

13892,"I see many people that say that they are suicidal talk about these things in their life that make it awful. The thing is, while I had a pretty rough childhood, I currently have a life that many people strive for. I have an absolutely wonderful job as a Registered Nurse working on an inpatient oncology floor. I have a great work schedule and only have to work three days a week even though my work is something that I could enjoy if I felt anything. I like the opportunity available to me to help people, and if I could feel anything, I know that I would be happy with the job that I have. The familial support that I have is also wonderful. I have a family that loves me to the end of the Earth and would do anything for me. I have a great dad that I talk to multiple times a week and is always available when I need him. I have a twin brother that I can say anything to and will always support me. I have a sister that I love and also enjoy talking to every week or so. I have an aunt that is only a couple of years older than me and is also very supportive. Best of all, I have an uncle that considers me his second son and would do absolutely anything for me. His wife, my aunt, is also very loving and is willing to drive me to my electroconvulsive therapy appointments, and it does not matter how out of the way it is. She is not a blood relative, but I love her as well. The things in my life that one would consider bad are things that result from my own choices. I do not have friends because I am a socially isolated introvert with severe social anxiety that I can only control when I am at work and even then just barely. Despite all of the good in my life, I still want to die. I think about it every day. I am almost always considering ways that I could kill myself. Anytime that death is brought up, I think about ways to use that method of death to end my life. Every so often, I will look up the LD50 of the medications that I am on so that I could end my life successfully. Recently, I looked up the price of a gun to use that to kill myself. I guess the good thing about the laws concerning firearms is that you cannot buy a gun online and have it shipped to your house. In this scenario, my death is prevented by my anxiety. I am too anxious to go to a store to buy a gun. Another thing that I do is consider attempting to OD and immediately calling EMS so that people can see that my desire to end my life is real and that I do feel as bad as I say. Irrationally, I feel jealous when I hear that people have had suicide attempts because I have always sought help when I have been that close to a suicide attempt.

We saw eachother almost every day, and talked EVERY single day, without getting into too much detail we were MUCH closer than your average best friend. I have been working on myself for a little over a year, and Id say my mental state for the most part is much better than its been the past few years, and she has been much help with my journey. But at times, I would start arguments with her over minuscule things, that at the time I feel are big. Last week started many little fights that added up. I had the first panic attack I have had in years, and stupid me started drinking (I am not an alcoholic, I just needed something to clear my head) She asked for space, but I kept texting her, I told her I was going to commit suicide because of her ignoring me, and that I was going to go to her house. (I was not going to actually go anywhere as I was inebriated, and I was not intending on physically harming her if that is what it sounds like, I just looked for any outlet of attention). At this point there was no return. I quickly realized the damage I had done, no one should have to deal with the emotional trauma I gave her. Its been almost a week and she wants nothing to do with me. I am not typically a dependent person, but in my entire life I have never met someone so relatable, and I screwed it all up. I have made a few attempts to mend things, but she wants no part. I know the answer is give her space and expect that its over and move on, but I feel terrible. I now have no one, I am alone, but worse, I have hurt her to the point of her being scared of me. My entire family line suffers from depression or bipolar, and I see no light at the end.

22349,"When I was around 10-13 years old, I was very social and made people like me. However, since I left my country at 13 y o I became an outcast. Since the first day of school, I was bullied and made fun of without the ability to defend myself because I did not speak the language of the country I went to. I was so excluded that I had to aimlessly walk in circles in the middle school's playing ground because nobody wanted to talk to me. I felt so awkward. I even followed the other kids in hopes of them including me but I was completely ignored. I was like a ghost to them. Everybody seemed to have fun. It destroyed me to point of shattering my true self-esteem. I endured two years at that middle school then we moved out to another city. At that point, I craved human interaction, was at my ugliest, and started self-harming. Out of nowhere, a girl in my class sees my fresh self-harming scars and tells me that she did the same thing, trying to dissuade me from continuing that practice. We even started chatting on social media trying to ease each other's pain. that is until I told her that I wanted to end it all and that I loved her. She threatened to call the police, which changed my mind. But that destroyed the bond that we developed and, like a dick, I started trying to guilt her into loving me. Things went south and long story short I became known as the depressed, self-harming, crying-in-school kid (teachers knew about the hit that I did). A status that I would not wish on my worst enemies. Fast forward to my first year of high school. I am still a shadow of my former self trying but I thought that I was reformed. Especially after befriending some friends. I acquired a gym membership and even willingly did a speech to my class, at the end of the year talking about how people change, how our class was perfect class accepting of everyone, and being a microcosm that could meticulously project our society. A microcosm where we can find the future: artists, doctors, architects, engineers, and more. Ending the speech with the confession of my love to a girl. Everything seemed going right. ""I am improving,"" I said to myself. Then year 2 comes. The whole year, my ""friends"" and I only talked in school. Rarely texting and we do it is for me being used as a tool for something. I spent all the holidays alone on my pc trying to lie on myself saying things like ""I do not need friends anyway"", ""I am happy"". Sometimes, I unveil my true feelings and start crying by the least trigger such as reading about how much people are having fun in their lives. I hate it when I see people happy. I hate god. I hate my life. I hate the wealthy who can do whatever the fuck they want (and do not fkn tell me how money does not buy happiness because a depressed wealthy person is \*100 better than a poor depressed person) And I certainly would have driven a fkn spear to my heart if it was not for the fact that I am a coward and that my parents have already paid for my college preparation year.

8321,"Hi. So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me (21), she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines/toys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up, I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14, I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up (one street over) and as soon as I got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him, but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall, I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I, that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked (mental breakdown?) but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies, get everything in order. I said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him.

45791,"Alternatives to Lamictal Hi guys. I have bipolar 2. I’ve been on Lamictal for about three years I think. But I think it’s giving me a rash. I have eczema so it’s hard to tell. My dermatologist took a biopsy to see if the rash is being caused by the med. Meanwhile, I’m kind of a mess. I’m gonna need a mood stabilizer. I talked to my psychiatrist today (on a Saturday)-called and left a msg and she called me back. She’s going to see me tomorrow (yes, on a Sunday!) at no charge. She asked me if I had ever been on Depakote. I have not. She wants to try that, for now. I should get the results of the biopsy by the end of next week.

I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager.

My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless, I still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level, I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life. Even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant, I would feel nothing but the phantom pain.

We agreed it was in our best interests to freeze the friendship for a while until I got better.At multiple occassions (because I impulsively made contact anyways) he assured me now was not the time but there would be a time in the future for us to catch-up and start over as it were. During all this I still did not get better. My depression got way worse and I got heavily suicidal.Today it has been almost 4 months since my last small impulsive message (and about 8 or 9 months since we stopped propely talking), and I found out he blocked me on Instagram and Facebook, our main ways of communication. I checked with dummy accounts to see if I was really blocked or just doom-thinking, but I am blocked. He already stopped following on Spotify a few months ago and at the same time removed me as his Insta follower, but this is a whole new step.I know how pathetic it is, but this really makes me want to end it all. I care so much about him, and he does not care about me, seemingly. He ends our friendship in secret by blocking me. It might even have happened 3 months ago, I only just found out by investigating myself. I apparently have not even earned enough respect and love to get a message. If he does not care about me, then no one does.

50410,"my bipolar is mostly just ✨spicy depression ✨ Sure, I get some highs (cyclothymia) but at this point most of my short life was spent in depression.

I tried most flavours of depression : there is the burnt out one, the high functioning one, the low functioning one, the one where you lay in bed for weeks, the one where you pretend everything is fine but you just stare at a blank wall all day, the one where you can't speak anymore, etc

And I only got a sprinkle of highs. I know I shouldn't wish for more highs but the lows are so goddamn low, I just want to get at level 0. Hypomania is not a side dish in my plate : it's barely a spice. 

So spicy depression is my lot. I feel I'm always pretending to believe it's gonna be okay.

As the lonely person as I am I obviously feel in love with her really hard, because, you know, when no one is nice to you after many time. When finally someone is nice to you you think that person really care. Anyway, we became friends after she got a boyfriend (I never told her what I felt for her). Well we still being friends, also we are more closer friends. And, about 2 months ago we got more busy and we focused in our stuff and we get a little distant, in that two months ee only talked like 10 times (which is very few considering that we used to talk every day).Then, 3 weeks ago I met another girl, we started talking and there is good friendship growing between us, and I thought I was better because even when she is nice with me and all. I did not feel any kind 'romantic' feeling or something, as I felt with my other friend (let us name my old friend V, and my new friend K). And I thought I jave already overcame V and I was not in love with her anymore, I was very shure.And, well, some days ago, we made a videocall after more than 3 weeks without any interaction between us. And when I saw her (V), I felt weird again, and I think I fell in love with her again, or maybe I never stopped being in love with her. Idk. I saw her cute face, and those beautiful green eyes, and I could not do anything to not fell something for her again.The problem here is that, V has a boyfriend, she do not like me in that way, and I thought I was very good being her friend. I thought I had already finished with that feelings to her. I am confused. Why I still like her? I do not want to be tied to her always. I promised I will not interfere in her life in that way.The growing friendship with K made me thought that I was good again, and I could let V 'go' if I wanted. But, I dot know why I still like her. This is confusing, and I am afraid I start acting like a dumb with any of them. I just want peace, I have many other problems to worry about, this is not helping me with my depression. And also, if these means I really really like V. The situation would be very shitty for me, because she has a boyfriend and I have no chance with her. I know I would never achieve something with her, I am not her kind. And my mind is tricking me again, making fake scenarios where V is involved, and I do not even notice when it happens.

It felt like I finally had a chance beyond a life of suffering, wage slaving, being stuck in a low socio economic swamp. I cannot even afford going to college anymore. Since March, got help, that is, therapy and a psychiatrist which neither I feel so far has really helped in any significant fashion. I actually have, since sessions and being prescribed medication, sunk even worse into a black pit of despair. I do not think people understand even the basic surface level of mental health solutions in modern day. Just seeing a therapist and taking meds will not fix everyone. The state of how, at least in America, mental health treatment is addressed is frankly a joke. It was easier for me to get prescribed antidepressants than ordering a pizza. I flat out told my therapist that I thought my psychiatrist is a fucking clown. 15 minute session where you briefly describe your symptoms, almost like a WebMD referral robot, but it is an actual licensed professional and they just throw pills at you at the end of the expensive session; voila, come back for an in progress consultation if you need to more dosage or to hop to a different med that probably will have another slew of side effects. Talk to anyone that is actively, or have been in therapy and ask them how many therapists they been to before they found ""the right one"". Why is there such a core difference with these professionals? Because it is honestly a goddamn circus internally, and I assume there is no standardized method of licensed schooling apparently.

All of this has been diagnosed professionally.I had a very rough upbringing. When I was young I definitely tried to avoid it, but there is only so much you can do. My mother was a depressed single parent who was a hoarder. She was gay and my dad was not around, so I often got made fun of as a child from other kids. For a few years in my early childhood her partner was an alcoholic who burned all of our things, so that was awful. I just saw every bad side of life as a child, I feel like.As a teenager I was sexually assaulted a few times. That definitely made things worse for me. I have not really talked about it a lot, but I do have nightmares about it and random times where I just cannot get sexual with my boyfriend. As an adult I have had issues with jobs. I never got to go to college, I had to leave home at 17 and afterwords I just never had the money to go to school, I also did not have the support. My ADHD is so severe that for a long time I was medicated on the strongest doses they had. We tried 3 different medications, nothing seemed to work. I was either hyper, or a zombie with no appetite.

Never been diagnosed with AvPD as I am too scared of asking my therapist what he thinks since by his writing he doesn't seem to care much about PD labels and I'm too afraid I will look like one of those people who tries to be cute/quirky/unique/special by hunting for diagnoses. But I resonate a lot with the stories and thoughts/feelings I have read from people who have AvPD and a lot of it sounds like things I have said/thought/felt almost word for word.

I'm curious if anyone here can relate to my childhood or if I'm being over-dramatic. I won't go into it too much because no one cares about my stupid sob story about why I'm a loser, but I basically had a very emotionally dismissive mom (""it's your fault for being upset"") and an explosively angry father (taught me it was NEVER ok to say ""no""). Since both of them worked all day I was pretty much raised by my older (half-)sister who had issues of her own (obviously) and she would constantly bully and belittle me. My (half-)brother essentially ignored me when I was growing up. I was also constantly bullied in elementary/middle school for being weird and shy, and had to see therapists that I didn't want to talk to when I was as young as 6/7 years old.

I'm 26 years old and have never dated/kissed/had sex with anyone and have never made any attempt to do so. I don't have any friends (except on the internet).

This subreddit is new to me, I didnt think I was bipolar. 

I had a ""mental health consult"" with my new GP today. He thinks I MIGHT be bipolar. He's prescribed me 25mg Seroquel to take an hour before bed, daily. Only until I get an actual psychiatrist to weigh in on it (appt isnt until june).

I hadn't heard about the drug until today, I've only ever been on citalopram 20mg for depression, it didnt help and made me suicidal.

I dont have problems sleeping. Actually, I told him I sleep too much, if anything. It seems that a lot of people that are prescribed seroquel do. I'm reading all of these horror stories about being crazy high and hallucinations that I've kind of scared myself from taking it.

I dont know if I should be taking it given he doesnt know what my actual diagnosis is. Should I be terribly concerned about the side effects?

21857,"so after being seriously depressed for months (to the point of using alcohol to cope) and going through a couple of depressive episodes for at least a year if not longer, coupled with low self esteem and almost if not no self worth for as long ad i can remember, i finally decided i needed to get help. However, i did not have a primary care doctor so i booked an appointment with a pcp to specifically talk about my mental health to talk about actions to take and discuss how I have been feeling. after asking me several assessment questions (again this was the entire point of the visit) she told me she believes i have anxiety and depression and prescribed me low dose zoloft. The first night I had terrible anxiety and could not sleep. last night was a little better but still, i could not sleep. Today was particularly bad. My mind started racing and i was incredibly depressed for about 3 hours after taking it and had some pretty dark thoughts. i was in bed in the dark and that did not help, so i tried watching a funny show and playing video games. not even 10 minutes into both of those activities and i lost interest. i finally decided i needed to do something so i decided to bake and cook dinner. i still felt horrible and i started panicking scared i was just going to continue to be sad and be depressed forever. i sat there worried i had too much time on my hands and i was going to be sad all that time.(i do not have work until later in the day the bext two days) again, still having dark thoughts. after reaching out to a couple people and getting affirmations from them i started saying out loud that i am worthy and that i do not deserve to feel like this and that i will get better and live a long good life. and that it does not matter if everyone else thinks I am worthless, i know i am worthy. i am worthy of getting better. and i will. i repeated this to myself for about 20-30 minutes and it completely lifted my mood. i feel so much better. I am apprehensive to get too excited though because I am worried its just a side effect of the medication (I have only been on it for 3 days) and that it will wear off. I am hoping that is not the case though because it feels good to feel more normalps. yes. I do plan on seeking therapy. Improvement? Or just a side affect of medication?",Depression

34975,"Shortness of Breath Hi,

I'm a 28 year old relatively healthy male who experienced my first ever panic attack on January 3rd (after waking up sometime in the beginning of December having a mini-attack and shortness of breath followed for weeks). I was sitting at home watching Friends and my left arm started tingling and immediately my heart started pounding and I started sweating - I eventually calmed down and went to the emergency room (i've never done that before) to get checked out - the doctor checked my blood pressure, oxygen, etc and said everything looked fine. 

I felt really weird after that. I had an appointment with my family doctor to get blood work, an ECG, and a lung/chest x-ray done and yesterday I was told that everything looked fine on the scans.

Today I got shortness of breath again. Has anybody experienced something like this before? Is it normal for shortness of breath to linger for a few months when you're feeling stressed?

I don't want to become a hypochondriac and I trust my doctor but it just feels off to me.

51002,"Severe anxiety, phone addiction and clinginess I am slightly shaking as I'm writing this. I hope this post isn't all over the place.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried everything to combat my phone addiction; from productivity apps to uninstalling social media (and reinstalling them again) etc. I gave up on school, despite having been a very bright kid who skipped middle school grades as an immigrant to a new country, but now I'm an extremely miserable and depressed 19 year old girl with absolutely no life and with severe anxiety. I keep my mind occupied by scrolling endlessly on my phone. My go-to coping mechanism used to be daydreaming, but now even daydreaming costs too much energy and the content of the dreams are almost involuntary and disturbing, so now I dissociate differently through scrolling endlessly and losing track of time as well as my surroundings, for 10+ hours a day. Now, my heart is beating hard and I'm feeling extra anxious and panicky, all because I turned off my phone. I tried to get away from my laptop too, but here I am writing this. I have pretty noticeable chest pain as a reaction of trying to avoid numbing my brain scrolling on tiktok. I feel pathetic.  


 Currently, I am having a really bad time. I feel left out and abandoned. My only friend and boyfriend, who's the most wonderful human being, is out with his friends. I'm happy for him, but we haven't been able to call or play together for a week and even though I am an adult, I am not in a place where I can just go hang out with him. I kept my relationship with him a secret from my parent who I live with, to keep the peace and to not destroy the heart of my exceptionally kind, loving and sacrificial mother, who happens to be religious. My other siblings and I have disappointed her enough, especially me, her once very happy, intelligent, bright and ambitious baby. She knows I don't have friends, or a job, or any activities for that matter. I almost never leave the house except for going to my therapy sessions. So, coming up with excuses to see my boyfriend has also been a huge challange. He has done his absolute best during our relationship. He is the most caring, compassionate and nurturing partner of all time. He is my best friend, a person I can be playful and comfortable with, and I try not to make my AvPD or other mental health stuff effect him. I don't want him to feel guilty having fun with his friends, but I am so extremely jealous. He can go out and do whatever he wants and he has friends he can do things with. Even if I'm his priority, due to my circumstances I can't even make it all worth is. I'm currently depressed and have nothing fun to talk about or do, I can't even find excuses to leave the house. So I'm not blaming him, I am blaming myself for all of it. For how I feel, for the guilt I feel after realizing how jealous and bitter my feelings are, for being so uninteresting and for not doing more to change,  


Trying not to use my phone now all of the sudden may also have to do with the fact that I don't want to stare at my notification the entire time, waiting for a text from him. If he doesn't text, I feel lonely and left out. If he does text, I feel like I will never experience ever going to places and parties with him and I get jealous. I don't let him know these feelings while I'm feeling them. I love this person immensely. He gets worried about me, and I don't want his weekend to be ruined by his clingy gf, even though when I have breakdowns of any kind he reassures me that I didn't ruin his day and he prioritizes me over other stuff in his day to just either come and be with me (we live in different cities)  or call me until I feel better.   


I want him to be happy. I have seen the positive impact I had on his life, and his impact on mine, and I'm scared that my loneliness and clinginess could hurt him, or hurt either of us, so I try to tone it down as much as I could. I'm tired, I miss him so much and I also feel bad for missing him, because  I find it near impossible to do anything else with my time that he is the only thing left in my life.",Personality disorder

I've spent so long thinking there's something wrong with me and constantly questioning why I can't just find things as easy as everyone else seems to do. Why I can't just be normal?

To actually have a name for it and relate to so much of what people post on here, it's kind of a relief to know that there's some reason that I'm actually like this and just knowing that this is why.

Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off, headaches everyday, cant go out cant do anything, i can barely even be on my phone, lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back.

If I tell someone happy birthday with a Facebook post they will delete my post because they are ashamed to be seen interacting with me. I have been bullied my entire life.I do not belong. People are ashamed and embarrassed of me including my family. I am hated or avoided before I even open my mouth. This world will not give me a chance. I am excluded from regular society.

23284,Its not that i worry to much about my life is just i do not worry at all about myself. I am always hating myself because i cannot keep up with what people want or what i think they want and no matter how many times times a person tell me not to worry and that they do not care i cannot listen to them. Like when my parents mentioned the price of therapy I could not care about the pain l. I only cared about the burden my existence was putting on the people around me. How do I care about myself,Depression
51563,"Fear is the death of potential, comfort it's instrument. Deep down, I'm still that poor, scared little boy who lost his confidence, beaten and humiliated and alone. So desperately alone   

Beyond that, and deeper, perhaps, is a skeleton where the man should be; held together by wishes and fantasies of what it means to be, of what it means to deserve, and the empty bravado and bloviations of a synthetic confidence made of air.  

Now, I can play the role of the confident man. I can laugh and smile and charm and begile and speak with an iron certainty that brooks no argument, and most would be tricked into thinking this is strength, but these are nothing more than the desperate, craven thrusts of defense - a pained and insecure theatre to hide my own inadequacy from inquiring eyes. 

I feel so worthless, so replaceable, so expendable. If I am not the absolute best, then how can I be valuable at all? How can someone not replace me? How can I feel secure within my relationship with others? 

Everywhere I look, I notice others better than me. People who are better looking, taller, smarter, with nicer bodies, and I cannot escape the realisation that these people could replace and take from me everything that I hold dear. 

I have an adoring girlfriend, but how long will that last? How can I trust in permanence when so many better than me exist? When the wheels of fate are always in motion, spinning towards a yet unknown destination? 

Every man man is my rival.  Every man is better than me. I must be perfect, otherwise I am worthless. 

Somewhere along the way, during adolescence and early adulthood, fear gripped my heart. It squeezed and twisted me into submission, until I felt powerless to travel any road that was not certain and safe. 

In persuing safety, I was tricked into embracing comfort, which came for me in the from of constant daily drinking. 

For five years, I drank and drank and isolated, until I was emaciated, malnourished, alone, so desperately alone, wasted, pitiful, weak, hopeless, and broken. 

The indifference and apathy that was birthed by alcohol facilitied me leaving university, abandoning the future I had dreamed of since a small boy, and finally extinguishing the withering flame of hope that I did not know still existed inside of me.

I slept on empty rum bottles, littering a dirty and dark floor in a small room. I seldom washed or showered or ate, and I only left the house to buy enough alcohol to fuel my two-letres-a-day rum habit. 

I was so alone, so desperately alone. 

I spent over half a year without any communication with others at all, and then only interacted with basic pleasantries in the couple of years that followed. 

Yet somehow, against all predictions, I stopped drinking. That was almost two years ago now. Since that moment, I have not faltered once, nor did I ever fear doing so. 

I was at rock bottom, I knew that I could not drink anymore.  The realisation hit me suddenly, with force sufficient to stop me mid step, on my way to buy rum.  A voice in my head, clear and confident and smooth, stated ""you can't do this anymore"", and thus, the decision to never drink again was made. And I cannot go against decisions already made, in the same way I cannot reverse the motion that broke a glass against the floor. 

From that moment, I have worked hard to build myself up from the creature I was. 

Now, on the precipice of achieving two years of uninterrupted sobriety, I have a new, respectable full-time job, I workout five times a week, I have a loving girlfriend, and yet I am haunted by the immutable weight of my own inadequacies and regrets. 

Everyone around me is more successful than I am. My girlfriend is currently on a buisness trip abroad, surrounded by other people of stature, significance, and importance. And what am I? An addict, a university dropout, and a worthless, talentless, static waste of life. 

I know that I cannot compare my life and success to others. Every person you meet has travelled a different path to yours, with different privillages and struggles, and a completely different set of potentials. I should only reflect on the life I have lived, judging my success by the progress I have made. I understand this, logically. It makes sense... Only, I cannot help but compare. I want to be more.  So much more. I need to be more. 

I want to go back to university, but I fear I am not smart enough. I had no confidence in going in the first place, but it was a path I was on, so I did not dwell on the fear. Now, with the flow of this path disrupted, I cannot find within myself the confidence to take the plunge back into formal education. I am inert with doubt. 

Why is it I cannot move past my regrets? Why do I feel so inadequate?",Personality disorder

Some days I get very depressed and I think about it basically all day but for some reason I am still here. Almost every night when I lay in bed its always on my mind keeping me awake. What would happen if I did it? Would people genuinely miss me? Would I ruin my families lives by doing it? Would the memory of me just fade away? Would people genuinely feel sad, or just surprised? The sad reality of it all is that even if I do it, these questions would remain unanswered, which is the hardest part of it all. I romanticize suicide all the time, I have made it my be all end all solution to everything in life...",Suicidal

52750,"Tingling in side/back of head Has anyone had head tingling/numbness with anxiety? I spent the last 15 minutes freaking out because I woke up today feeling somewhat very anxious. A few minutes later, I felt this crawling/tingling feeling that started from my left temple to the back of head. It comes and goes and boy.....the panic I felt with it was the icing on top of the cake. There's no pain whatsoever, but just a weird sensation that makes me feel like the left side of my head is going numb.

This is the first time it's happened to me. I have been somewhat anxious these past few days (about my health), so I'm not sure if that is the trigger? I don't have any headaches whatsoever. And I'm refraining from googling because I know whatever I'm reading is gonna aggravate my anxiety. But my brain has decided that it's best to jump to the worst case scenario 🫠 I'm trying to keep calm because I know if I let my thoughts run loose, it's going to make me feel worse.

But I'm really wondering if it's the stress/anxiety causing it. My neck/shoulders feel relatively fine, so I don't think it's a pulled muscle or tension.",Anxiety
